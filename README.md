# Scenarios-Assessment-of-Integrated-Assessment-Models-and-Institutions
This repository is about assessing existing energy-climate scenarios from different Integrated Assessment Models (as used in IPCC Special Report on 1.5 C) as well as different instituted such as BP, IEA and Shell.

The script is written in Python programming language and uses regular packages such as ```pandas```, ```matplotlib``` and ```numpy```. Besides, the ```pyam``` package is used for exploring the scenarios data from IAMs in the form of IAM dataframe. 

The data is present in the ```data``` folder and the resulting plots are present in ```figures``` folder.
